Riak(Search) @ Gander
=====================

We use Riaksearch along with MongoDB & Gearmand to provide a scalable backend
for our web-app. Currently, the app is still in a closed, private, alpha.

Riak provides some of the features which are lacking from MongoDB (for
us at least), such as full-text search and homogenous (& easy) servers.

Specific details, will be entered soon.
